Hi there, this is Anik Sarker, an Electrical and Electronics Engineering final-year student. I am a self-taught software developer. I do full-stack development with the latest technology out there. I embrace the idea of good practice and clean code. </br> </br>
I have experience in building scalable and maintainable web applications. My skills include building responsive and user-friendly interfaces using React, and Nextjs, as well as developing server-side applications using frameworks such as Node.js. I also have experience with various databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Firebase.
